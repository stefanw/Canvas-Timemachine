This is a major rewrite of the original with Canvas instead of divs. It's now modularized and also contains image preloading.

Use it like this:

    var timemachine = TimeMachine.create(images, ctx, settings, imagesDoneLoadingCallback);
    /* images is an array, elements can be URLs of images or image objects
     * ctx is the 2D graphics context
     * optional custom settings, see example
     * optional callback function when image loading is done
     */
    timemachine.backward();
    timemachine.forward();
    timemachine.moveTo(3);
    
index.html provides a short example ([online version here](http://stefanwehrmeyer.com/_projects/timemachine/)).

You can see it in action on [BPMN Community](http://en.bpmn-community.org/process/timemachine/46/) (there is also a timemachine-related easter egg on the site).
